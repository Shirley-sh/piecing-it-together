        <h1>Midterm Project: The Screem</h1>

        <h3>Phase 1: Idea</h3>
        <p>The idea of this project is to make a 3D version of those old oil painting in wood and we decided to start with "The Scream" by Edvard Munch. </p>
        <p>We traced the original oil painting in Illustrator. Here is the draft showing how we will divide the layers.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Prototype</h3>
        <p>However, we soon realized that the lines of the draft is too rough and they cannot be cut as whole pieces because many of they are closed separately.
        So later we spent a lot of time on modifying the lines in order to make them smoother and make sure they are all connected to each other.
        </p>

        <p>Our fist prototype was done in card paper by vinyl cutter. It has three hollow layers with a background box on the bottom.</p>

        <p>In our first version, we had the face of the man on a separate layer. It was very hard to adhere them to the head, especially for the nose. In fact, it looks better if we just cut off the face from the head. We made our second version.</p>

        <p>Card paper is an excellent material for prototyping. It is cheap and quick to put together. It also makes easier to "debug" the design. Especially when we were tearing the paper from the cutting mat, we were able to tell which part of the paper is weak, so that we can go back to our design and make the lines thicker.</p>
